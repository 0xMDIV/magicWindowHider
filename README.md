# magicWindowHider
hides windows when you click at them, wasnt supposed to do this but whatever
i tryed to have a python window always on top of other windows, but i kinda failed there
the magicWindowHider hides any window you click on your computer, yes even the taskbar, 
shortcuts like ctrl + E for the explorer arent working anymore

# How to stop it
ctrl + alt + del -> terminate the python process
or
restart your computer

# Warning
Dont destroy someones computer with this script
You could force a user to reinstall windows by compiling it as exe and replace cmd.exe and taskmgr.exe with the new exe
so when you also add it to the startup, you cant stop it anymore - Eductional Test Case on a VM ONLY

# Dont do anything stupid with it, its just for trolling
